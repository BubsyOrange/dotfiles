#+TITLE: Bubsy's Dotfiles

A collection of my own personal configuartion files.

* What Are Dotfiles?

Dotfiles are configuration files used on Linux or any Unix-based system. You can tell if a file is a dotfile because it starts with a period--in other words, a dot! The period at the beginning of the filename or directory
indicates that it is a hidden file or directory. This repository contains my own personal dotfiles that I use.
